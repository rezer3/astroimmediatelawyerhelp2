            Tax matters often involve strict deadlines, notices, and significant financial consequences.
            The sections below outline common situations where speaking with a tax attorney may help.
          </p>

          <section class="taxSection">
            <h3>IRS Audits &amp; Examinations</h3>
            <p>
              An IRS audit can involve requests for documents, interviews, or examinations of prior returns.
              Representation can help ensure responses are accurate, timely, and appropriately limited in scope.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="taxSection">
            <h3>Back Taxes &amp; Tax Debt</h3>
            <p>
              Owed taxes can accumulate penalties and interest over time.
              Options may include payment plans, offers in compromise, or dispute of assessed balances.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="taxSection">
            <h3>Tax Liens &amp; Levies</h3>
            <p>
              Liens and levies can affect wages, bank accounts, and property.
              Acting quickly may help stop or reduce collection actions while options are reviewed.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="taxSection">
            <h3>Unfiled Tax Returns</h3>
            <p>
              Failure to file required returns can trigger substitute returns, penalties, and enforcement actions.
              Filing correctly and in the right order can significantly affect total liability.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="taxSection">
            <h3>Business &amp; Payroll Tax Issues</h3>
            <p>
              Payroll taxes and trust fund recovery penalties can create personal exposure for business owners.
              These matters often require careful handling and documentation.

          Tax agencies operate on strict schedules. Missing a deadline or responding incorrectly
          can reduce available options. Early review often provides more flexibility.
